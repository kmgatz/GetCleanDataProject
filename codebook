The Data Cleaning Project
All necessary data is in a directory UCIHARDataset on the working directory (also runanalysis.R is stored in this directory and programmed to run there)
•	test/x_test.txt – test dataset
•	train/x_train.txt – training dataset
•	test/y_test.txt – labels for test dataset
•	train/y_train.txt – labels for training dataset
•	activity_labels.txt – descriptive names of activities
•	test/subject_test.txt – subjects who performed activity in test dataset
•	train/subject_train.txt – subjects who performed activity in train dataset
•	features.txt – List of all features

#Information about Variables
Variables used in within the script
•	testdatafile and traindatafile – used to store names of each file to be read in
•	testSubject - data frame with data from subject_test.txt
•	trainSubject - data frame with data from subject_train.txt
•	dtSubject – binded Subject data
•	testY – data frame with data from Y_test.txt
•	trainY – data fram with data from Y_train.txt
•	dtY – binded Y data
•	testX – data frame with data from X_test.txt
•	trainX – data frame with data from X_train.txt
•	dtX – binded X data
•	dtActivityNames data frame with numeric and descriptive activity
•	dtFeatures –labels for features variable
•	dtAll – binded all test & train data
•	dtSub – subset of dtAll only with variables & data with measurements (mean & std)
•	dtAnswer – data summarized with means

#Steps in script
1.	Loading data into variable
2.	Cleaning data
3.	Merge datasets and creating one big dataset
4.	Extract datasets with mean & std variable name
5.	Change activities to descriptive name
6.	Perform summary with means
